Aural.js
========

An attempt at aggregating all my previous work on audio in a single library.

The library is divided in two major namespace : Music and Sound.

Aural.Music operates at the macro level and handles things like Notes, Intervals, Chords and Scales.

Aural.Sound operates at the micro level and handles things like synthesis, samples, granularization, etc.
